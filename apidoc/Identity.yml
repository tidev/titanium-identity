summary: Allows a Titanium application to use the iOS Touch ID / Face ID authentication mechanism.

extends: Titanium.Module
description: |
    Touch ID / Face ID are security mechanisms that use biometric sensors to authenticate the user.

    ### Requirements

    The Identity module is available with the Titanium SDK starting with Release 6.3.0.
    This module only works with devices running iOS 8 and later.

    ### Getting Started

    Add the module as a dependency to your application by adding a **`<module>`** item to the
    **`<modules>`** element of your `tiapp.xml` file:

        <ti:app>
          ...
          <modules>
            <module platform="iphone">ti.identity</module>
          </modules>
          ...
        </ti:app>

    Use `require()` to access the module from JavaScript:

        var Identity = require('ti.identity');

    The `Identity` variable is a reference to the module. Make API calls using this reference:

        Identity.authenticate({
            reason: 'Verify to modify personal settings',
            callback: function(e) {
                Ti.API.info(e);
            }
        });

    ### Lifetime Notes (iOS-only)

    The current context will, once evaluated, be used until it's instance gets released or invalidated.
    You can you use the <Modules.Identity.invalidate> method to force the user to be prompted every time a
    new authentication is triggered. On iOS 9 and later, this can also be called to cancel a current
    evaluation of an auth-context, e.g. to hide the auth-dialoag.

    ## Distinguish between Touch ID and Face ID

    Use the <Modules.Identity.biometryType> to receive the currently used biometry type. See an example of
    using the property to create a personalized interface when using Touch ID and Face ID:

        var authPhrase = 'Unknown';

        if (TiIdentity.biometryType === TiIdentity.BIOMETRY_TYPE_FACE_ID) { // Face ID
            authPhrase = 'Face ID';
        } else if (TiIdentity.biometryType === TiIdentity.BIOMETRY_TYPE_TOUCH_ID) { // Touch ID
            authPhrase = 'Touch ID';
        }
        
    ## Face ID Requirements (iOS only)

    For Face ID to work properly, you need to add a **`<key>`** item to the
    **`<plist>`** element of your `tiapp.xml` file:

        <ti:app>
          ...
          <ios>
            ...
            <plist>
              <dict>
                <key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
                <string>Why you need Face ID.</string>
              </dict>
            </plist>
            ...
          </ios>
          ...
        </ti:app>

    ### Native Keychain Integration

    For more infos regarding the keychain integration, check the "KeychainItem" "documentation.

    ### Sample Application

    The module contains a sample application in the
    `<TITANIUM_SDK_HOME>/modules/iphone/ti.identity/<VERSION>/example/` folder.

methods:
  - name: authenticate
    summary: Initiates the biometric authentication process.
    description: |
      A special note for Android:

      When you call this method in Android, if you provide an incorrect fingerprint and receive an error
      message "Unable to recognize fingerprint", do not call authenticate. Instead, get the user to try
      again. If you call authenticate, it will end up in a bad state. This flow will be improved in the
      next update for Android.
    parameters:
      - name: params
        summary: Dictionary of arguments passed to the method, e.g. the reason to autheicate and the callback.
        type: IdentityAuthenticationType

  - name: invalidate
    summary: Invalidates the current biometric dialog.
    description: |
        The context is invalidated automatically when it is (auto)released.

        This method allows invalidating it manually while it is still in scope.
        Invalidation terminates any existing policy evaluation and the respective call will
        fail with <Modules.Identity.ERROR_APP_CANCELLED>. After the context has been invalidated, it can not be
        used for policy evaluation and an attempt to do so will fail with <Modules.Identity.ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT>.

        See the "Lifetime Notes (iOS-only)" paragraph in the module paragraph for more infos.

  - name: deviceCanAuthenticate
    summary: Checks to see if device is configured for biometric authentication.
    description: |
        On Android this takes into account the `authenticationPolicy`.

        Example:
            var Identity = require("ti.identity");
            var result = Identity.deviceCanAuthenticate();
            if (!result.canAuthenticate) {
                alert('Message: ' + result.error + '\nCode: ' + result.code);
            } else {
                alert('Device can authenticate');
            }
    returns:
        type: DeviceCanAuthenticateResult

  - name: isSupported
    summary: Determines if the current device supports Touch ID or Face ID.
    returns:
        type: Boolean

properties:
  - name: authenticationPolicy
    summary: Sets the global authentication policy used in this Touch ID / Face ID context.
    description: |
        You should set this property before checking the availability or
        starting the authentication. By default, `AUTHENTICATION_POLICY_BIOMETRICS`
        will be used to authenticate using the Touch ID / Face ID sensor only. Using the
        `AUTHENTICATION_POLICY_PASSCODE` constant will still try to authenticate
        with Touch ID / Face ID first and use the passcode as the fallback.

    description: |
        This property is set only when <Modules.Identity.isSupported> succeeds for a biometric policy.
        The default value is <Modules.Identity.BIOMETRY_TYPE_NONE>.

  - name: AUTHENTICATION_POLICY_PASSCODE
    summary: Device owner was authenticated by Touch ID or device passcode.
    description: |
        Touch ID or passcode authentication is required. If Touch ID is available,
        enrolled and not locked out, user is asked for it first, otherwise they are
        asked to enter device passcode. If passcode is not enabled, policy evaluation
        will fail.

        Touch ID authentication dialog behaves similarly as the one used by
        `AUTHENTICATION_POLICY_BIOMETRICS`. However, instead of "Enter Password"
        button there is "Enter Passcode" button which, when tapped, switches the
        authentication method and allows users to enter device passcode.

        Passcode authentication will get locked after 6 unsuccessful attempts with
        progressively increased backoff delay.

  - name: AUTHENTICATION_POLICY_BIOMETRICS
    summary: Device owner was authenticated using a biometric method.
    description: |
        A biometric authentication is required. If there are no biometrics available or not
        enrolled, policy evaluation will fail. If Touch ID / Face ID is locked out, passcode
        is required as the first step to unlock with Touch ID.

        Touch ID authentication dialog contains a cancel button with default title
        "Cancel" which can be customized using `cancelTitle` property and a fallback
        button with default title "Enter Password" which can be customized using
        `fallbackTitle` property. Fallback button is initially hidden and shows up
        after first unsuccessful Touch ID attempt. Tapping cancel button or fallback
        button causes evaluatePolicy call to fail, returning a distinct error code.

        Biometric authentication will get locked after 5 unsuccessful attempts.
        After that, users have to unlock it by entering passcode.
